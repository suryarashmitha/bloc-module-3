####Questions

> What is a hash table?

A: Hash tables, like arrays, are intended to be used as collections of similar data. They are commonly used to store data by some form of identifier. 

>  What is hashing?

A: Hash tables use hashing to convert string keys to numeric indices. Hashing is the conversion from a string to a numerical index. A hashing function is used to convert the key to a specific, fixed-length number, referred to as a hash code.

> How does a hash table store data?

A: A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs.

> How are hash tables and objects different?

A: If data we have is a static number of distinct values of different types, then use object to access it. Use a hash table when your data contains a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier.

> Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

A:
    * A list of pets and their unique names: `Object`
    * The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend: `Object`
    * The name and location of every company in a given city: `Hash Table`
    * All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual: `Hash Table`
    * The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact: `Object`

>  Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.

A: Code:
class Customer {
   constructor(name, address, phoneNumber) {
      this.name = name;
      this.address = address;
      this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
   }

	getHash() {
		return parseInt(this.phoneNumber);
	}
}

let customerList = [];

let surya = new Customer('Surya', 'MacArthur Blvd', '8482483111');

let dinesh = new Customer('Dinesh', 'N Glen Dr', '8482483222');

customerList[surya.getHash()] = surya;
customerList[dinesh.getHash()] = dinesh;

>  Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

A: class Inventory {
  constructor(item, count, serial) {
    this.item = item;
    this.count = count;
    this.serial = serial;
  }

  getHash() {
    return parseInt(this.serial);
  }
}

let inventoryList = [];

let yamahaRx = new Inventory('Yamaha RX-100', '4', '38011345680');

inventoryList[yamahaRx.getHash()] = yamahaRx;


>  Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

A: class Articles { 
	constructor(copy, publisher, pubDate) {
		this.copy = copy;
		this.publisher = publisher;
		this.pubDate = pubDate;
	}

	getHash() {
		return this.pubDate + ' ' + this.publisher;
	}
}

let compiledArticles = [];

let newArticle = new Articles('Global Warming and Coral Reefs', 'National Geographic', '07-24-2018');

compiledArticles[newArticle.getHash()] = newArticle;
