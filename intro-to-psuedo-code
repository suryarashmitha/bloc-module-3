#### Questions

> Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Pseudocode consists of a series of English-like statements that describe a task or algorithm. So it makes easy to read and understand your intentions.

> If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Pseudocode is meant for humans to read rather than machines, so it will not run on a computer.

####Programming Assignment

####Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

> Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A: Pseudocode:
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number
  PRINT "first number is greater"
ELSE IF first number is less than second number
  PRINT "second number is greater"
ELSE 
  PRINT "first and second numbers are same"
END IF

> Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A: Pseudocode:
FUNCTION printsNumbers
BEGIN 
  num=100 // num needs to start at 100
WHILE (num >= 0) //looping goes till num is greater than to equal to 0
  PRINT num
  num = num-1 // decrement 100 by 1
END WHILE
PRINT num
END

> Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

A: Pseudocode:
INPUT array of contacts
FUNCTION contactSearch with PARAMETER contact
  FOR index = 0
  Index leads than contacts length
    IF index of contacts === contact
	PRINT "found contact "+ contact + " at index " + i
	RETURN true
    END IF
  END FOR
 RETURN false
END FUNCTION
IF no contact
  PRINT "contact does not exist"


> Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A: Code:

var contacts = ["surya", "rashmitha", "dinesh", "sam", "pam"];

function contactSearch(contact) {
    for(var i=0; i < contacts.length; i++) {
        if(contacts[i] === contact) {
            console.log("Found contact " + contact + " at index " + i);
            return true;
        }
    } 
    return false;
}

var contact = contactSearch("surya");
if(!contact) {
    console.log('contact does not exist!');
}
